Feel free to tackle any of these or any other problems you find.  All
I ask is that you send me your changes so that they can be
incorporated into a common codebase for everyone to benefit from
(also, so you can get credit for your work!).

- tying of arrays

- rewriting the core of Shareable in C to gain speed
and memory efficiency

- perhaps add news ways to share data in addition to shared memory
 so that the module becomes portable

- have Shareable print proper error messages when system calls fail

- really blue sky: could the module overload some operators so that
their use will automatically invoke locking and unlocking of a tie()d
variable?

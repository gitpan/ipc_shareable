IPC::Shareable allows you to tie a a variable to shared memory making it
easy to share the contents of that variable with other Perl processes.
Currently either scalars or hashes can be tied; tying of arrays remains a
work in progress. However, the variable being tied may contain arbitrarily
complex data structures - including references to arrays, hashes of hashes,
etc. See <A HREF="#REFERENCES">REFERENCES</A> below for more information.


<P>

The association between variables in distinct processes is provided by
<EM>$glue</EM>. This is an integer number or 4 character string[1] that serves as a
common identifier for data across process space. Hence the statement


<P>

<PRE>        tie($scalar, IPC::Shareable, 'data');
</PRE>

<P>

in program one and the statement


<P>

<PRE>        tie($variable, IPC::Shareable, 'data');
</PRE>

<P>

in program two will bind <CODE>$scalar</CODE> in program one and
<CODE>$variable</CODE> in program two. There is no pre-set limit to the
number of processes that can bind to data; nor is there a pre-set limit to
the size or complexity of the underlying data of the tied variables[2].


<P>

The bound data structures are all linearized (using Raphael Manfredi's
Storable module) before being slurped into shared memory. Upon retrieval,
the original format of the data structure is recovered. Semaphore flags are
used for versioning and managing a per-process cache, allowing quick
retrieval of data when, for instance, operating on a <CODE>tie()d</CODE>
variable in a tight loop.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="OPTIONS">OPTIONS

</A></H1>
Options are specified by passing a reference to a hash as the fourth
argument to the tie function that enchants a variable. Alternatively you
can pass a reference to a hash as the third argument; IPC::Shareable will
then look at the field named <EM>'key'</EM> in this hash for the value of <EM>$glue</EM>. So,


<P>

<PRE>        tie($variable, IPC::Shareable, 'data', \%options);
</PRE>

<P>

is equivalent to


<P>

<PRE>        tie($variable, IPC::Shareable,
            { 'key' =&gt; 'data', ... });
</PRE>

<P>

When defining an options hash, values that match the word <EM>'no'</EM> in a case-insensitive manner are treated as false. Therefore, setting
<CODE>$options{'create'} = 'No';</CODE> is the same as <CODE>$options{'create'} =
0;</CODE>.


<P>

The following fields are recognized in the options hash.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_key">key

</A></STRONG><DD>
The <EM>'key'</EM> field is used to determine the <EM>$glue</EM> if <EM>$glue</EM> was not present in the call to <CODE>tie().</CODE> This argument is then,
in turn, used as the KEY argument in subsequent calls to
<CODE>shmget()</CODE> and <CODE>semget().</CODE> If this field is not
provided, a value of IPC_PRIVATE is assumed, meaning that your variables
cannot be shared with other processes. (Note that setting <EM>$glue</EM> to 0 is the same as using IPC_PRIVATE.)


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_create">create

</A></STRONG><DD>
If <EM>'create'</EM> is set to a true value, IPC::Shareable will create a new binding associated
with <EM>$glue</EM> if such a binding does not already exist. If <EM>'create'</EM> is false, calls to <CODE>tie()</CODE> will fail (returning undef) if such a
binding does not already exist. This is achieved by ORing IPC_PRIVATE into
FLAGS argument of calls to <CODE>shmget()</CODE> when
<EM>create</EM> is true.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_exclusive">exclusive

</A></STRONG><DD>
If <EM>'exclusive'</EM> field is set to a true value, calls to <CODE>tie()</CODE> will fail
(returning undef) if a data binding associated with <EM>$glue</EM>
already exists. This is achieved by ORing IPC_ IPC_EXCL into the FLAGS
argument of calls to <CODE>shmget()</CODE> when <EM>'exclusive'</EM> is true.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_mode">mode

</A></STRONG><DD>
The <EM>mode</EM> argument is an octal number specifying the access permissions when a new
data binding is being created. These access permission are the same as file
access permissions in that 0666 is world readable, 0600 is readable only by
the effective UID of the process creating the shared variable, etc. If not
provided, a default of 0666 (world readable and writable) will be assumed.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_destroy">destroy

</A></STRONG><DD>
If set to a true value, the data binding will be destroyed when the process
calling <CODE>tie()</CODE> exits (gracefully)[3].


<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="LOCKING">LOCKING

</A></H1>
Shareable provides methods to implement application-level locking of the
shared data structures. These methods are called <CODE>shlock()</CODE> and
<CODE>shunlock().</CODE> To use them you must first get the tied object,
either by saving the return value of the original call to
<CODE>tie()</CODE> or by using the built-in <CODE>tied()</CODE> function.


<P>

To lock a variable, do this:


<P>

<PRE>  $knot = tie($scalar, IPC::Shareable, $glue, { %options });
  ...
  $knot-&gt;shlock;
</PRE>

<P>

or equivalently


<P>

<PRE>  tie($scalar, IPC::Shareable, $glue, { %options });
  (tied $scalar)-&gt;shlock;
</PRE>

<P>

This will place an exclusive lock on the data of $scalar.


<P>

To unlock a variable do this:


<P>

<PRE>  $knot-&gt;shunlock;
</PRE>

<P>

or


<P>

<PRE>  (tied $scalar)-&gt;shunlock;
</PRE>

<P>

Note that there is no mechanism for shared locks, but you're probably safe
to rely on Shareable's internal locking mechanism in situations that would
normally call for a shared lock so that's not a big drawback. In general, a
lock only needs to be applied during a non-atomic write operation. For
instance, a statement like


<P>

<PRE>  $scalar = 10;
</PRE>

<P>

doesn't really need a lock since it's atomic. However, if you want to
increment, you really should do


<P>

<PRE>  (tied $scalar)-&gt;shlock;
  ++$scalar;
  (tied $scalar)-&gt;shunlock;
</PRE>

<P>

since ++$scalar is non-atomic.


<P>

Read-only operations are (I think) atomic so you don't really need to lock
for them.


<P>

There are some pitfalls regarding locking and signals that you should make
yourself aware of; these are discussed in <A HREF="#NOTES">NOTES</A>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="REFERENCES">REFERENCES

</A></H1>
If a variable <CODE>tie()d</CODE> to Shareable contains references,
Shareable acts in different ways depending upon the initial state of the
thingy being referenced.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="The_Thingy_Referenced_Is_Initial">The Thingy Referenced Is Initially False

</A></H2>
If Shareable encounters in a <CODE>tie()d</CODE> variable a reference to an
empty hash or a scalar with a false value, Shareable will attempt to
<CODE>tie()</CODE> the hash or scalar being referenced. If a reference is
to an empty array, Shareable defaults to its other behaviour described
below since Shareable cannot <CODE>tie()</CODE> arrays.


<P>

References to empty hashes can occur whenever a <CODE>tie()d</CODE>
variable is cast in a context that forces references to ``spring into
existence''. Consider, for instance, the following assignment to a
<CODE>tie()d</CODE> %hash:


<P>

<PRE>    $hash{'foo'}{'bar'} = 'xyzzy';
</PRE>

<P>

This statement assigns assigns to $hash{'foo'} a reference to an anonymous
hash. In the anonymous hash it assigns to the key 'bar' the value 'xyzzy'.
Since <CODE>%hash</CODE> is <CODE>tie()d,</CODE> the assignment triggers
Shareable, but when Shareable is called, the anonymous hash is still empty.
Shareable then immediately <CODE>tie()s</CODE> the anonymous hash so that
when the assignment { 'bar' = 'xyzzy' } is made, Shareable can catch it.


<P>

One consequence of this behaviour is a statement like


<P>

<PRE>    $scalar = {};
</PRE>

<P>

will, for a <CODE>tie()d</CODE> $scalar, Shareable to <CODE>tie()</CODE>
the anonymous hash. Consider this a supported bug. It does, however mean
that statements like


<P>

<PRE>    $scalar-&gt;{'foo'} = 'bar';
</PRE>

<P>

should work as expected.


<P>

Be warned, however, that each variable <CODE>tie()d</CODE> to Shareable
requires (at least) one shared memory segment and one set of three
semaphores. If you use this feature too liberally, you can find yourself
running out of semaphores quickly. If that happens to you, consider
resorting to Shareable other behaviour described in the following section.


<P>

Another potential problem at the time of writing with using this behaviour
is that locking using <CODE>shlock()</CODE> and <CODE>shunlock()</CODE> is
unreliable. This is because a data structure spans more than one
<CODE>tie()d</CODE> variable. It is advisable to implement your own locking
mechanism if you plan on using this behaviour of Shareable.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="The_Thingy_Referenced_Is_Initial">The Thingy Referenced Is Initially True

</A></H2>
If Shareable encounters in a <CODE>tie()d</CODE> variable a reference to a
hash with any key/value pairs, a reference to a true scalar, or a reference
to any array, the contents of the referenced thingy are slurped into the
same shared memory segment as the original <CODE>tie()d</CODE> variable.
What that means is that a statement like


<P>

<PRE>    $scalar = [ 0 .. 9 ];
</PRE>

<P>

makes the contents of the anonymous array referenced by a
<CODE>tie()d</CODE> <CODE>$scalar</CODE> visible to other processes.


<P>

The good side of this behaviour is that a data structure can be arbitrarily
complex and still only require one set of three semaphores. The downside
becomes evident when you try to modify the contents of such a referenced
thingy, either in the original process or elsewhere. A statement like


<P>

<PRE>    push(@$scalar, 10, 11, 12);
</PRE>

<P>

modifies only the untied anonymous array referenced by <CODE>$scalar</CODE>
and not the <CODE>tie()d</CODE> <CODE>$scalar</CODE> itself. Subsequently,
the change to the anonymous array would be visible only in the process
making this statement.


<P>

A workaround is to remember which variable is really <CODE>tie()d</CODE>
and to make sure you assign into that variable every time you change a
thingy that it references. An alternative to the above statement that works
is


<P>

<PRE>    $scalar = [ (@$scalar, 10, 11, 12) ];

<P>

Perhaps the most important thing to note the existence of the
<EM>'DATA'</EM> and <EM>'version'</EM> fields: data for all <CODE>tie()d</CODE> variables is stored locally in a
per-process cache. When storing data, the values of the semaphores referred
to by <EM>$Shm_Info{$id}{'sem_id'}</EM> are changed to indicate to the world a new version of the data is
available. When retrieving data for a <CODE>tie()d</CODE> variables, the
values of these semaphores are examined to see if another process has
created a more recent version than the cached version. If a more recent
version is available, it will be retrieved from shared memory and used. If
no more recent version has been created, the cached version is used.


<P>

Also stored in the <EM>'DATA'</EM> field is a structure that identifies any ``magically created''
<CODE>tie()d</CODE> variables associated with this variable. These
variables are created by assignments like the following:


<P>

<PRE>    $hash{'foo'}{'bar'} = 'xyzzy';
</PRE>

<P>

See <A HREF="#REFERENCES">REFERENCES</A> for a complete explanation.


<P>

Another important thing to know is that IPC::Shareable allocates shared
memory of a constant size SHM_BUFSIZ, where SHM_BUFSIZ is defined in this
module. If the amount of (serialized) data exceeds this value, it will be
fragmented into multiple segments during a write operation and reassembled
during a read operation.


<P>

Lastly, if notice that if you <CODE>tie()</CODE> a hash and begin iterating
over it, you will get data from and write to your local cache until
Shareable thinks you've reached the end of the iteration. At this point
Shareable writes out the entire contents of your hash to shared memory.
This is done so you can safely iterate via <CODE>keys(),</CODE>
<CODE>values(),</CODE> and <CODE>each()</CODE> without having to worry
about somebody else clobbering a key in the middle of the loop.

If <EM>$glue</EM> is longer than 4 characters, only the 4 most significant characters are
used. These characters are turned into integers by <CODE>unpack()ing</CODE>
them. If <EM>$glue</EM> is less than 4 characters, it is space padded.

IPC::Shareable provides no pre-set limits, but the system does. Namely,
there are limits on the number of shared memory segments that can be
allocated and the total amount of memory usable by shared memory.

If the process has been smoked by an untrapped signal, the binding will
remain in shared memory. If you're cautious, you might try


<P>

<PRE>    $SIG{INT} = \&amp;catch_int;
    sub catch_int {
        exit;
    }
    ...
    tie($variable, IPC::Shareable, 'data',
        { 'destroy' =&gt; 'Yes!' });
</PRE>

<P>

which will at least clean up after your user hits CTRL-C because
IPC::Shareable's DESTROY method will be called. Or, maybe you'd like to
leave the binding in shared memory, so subsequent process can recover the
data...

The integer happens to be the shared memory ID of the first shared memory
segment used to store the variable's data.

When using <CODE>shlock()</CODE> to lock a variable, be careful to guard
against signals. Under normal circumstances, Shareable's DESTROY method
unlocks any locked variables when the process exits. However, if an
untrapped signal is received while a process holds an exclusive lock,
DESTROY will not be called and the lock may be maintained even though the
process has exited. If this scares you, you might be better off
implementing your own locking methods.

The bulk of Shareable's behaviour when dealing with references relies on
undocumented (and possibly unsupported) features of perl. Changes to perl
in the future could break Shareable.

As mentioned in <A HREF="#INTERNALS">INTERNALS</A>, shared memory segments are acquired with sizes of SHM_BUFSIZ.
SHM_BUFSIZ's largest possible value is nominally SHMMAX, which is highly
system-dependent. Indeed, for some systems it may be defined at boot time.
If you can't seem to <CODE>tie()</CODE> any variables, it may be that
SHM_BUFSIZ is set a value that exceeds SHMMAX on your system. Try reducing
the size of SHM_BUFSIZ and recompiling the module.

The class contains a translation of the constants defined in the
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;, &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;, and &lt;sys/sem.h&gt; header files.
These constants are used internally by the class and cannot be imported
into a calling environment. To do that, use IPC::SysV instead. Indeed, I
would have used IPC::SysV myself, but I haven't been able to get it to
compile on any system I have access to :-(.

Use caution when choosing your values of $glue. If IPC::Shareable needs to
acquire more shared memory segments (due to a buffer overrun, or implicit
referencing), those shared memory segments will have a different
<CODE>$glue</CODE> than the <CODE>$glue</CODE> supplied by the application.
In general, <CODE>$glues</CODE> should be well separated: <STRONG>aaaa</STRONG> and <STRONG>zzzz</STRONG> are good choices, since they are unlikely to collide, but <STRONG>aaaa</STRONG> and <STRONG>aaab</STRONG>
could easily collide.

There is a program called <CODE>ipcs(1/8)</CODE> that is available on at
least Solaris and Linux that might be useful for cleaning moribund shared
memory segments or semaphore sets produced by bugs in either IPC::Shareable
or applications using it.

IPC::Shareable version 0.20 or greater does not understand the format of
shared memory segments created by earlier versions of IPC::Shareable. If
you try to tie to such segments, you will get an error. The only work
around is to clear the shared memory segments and start with a fresh set.

Set the variable <EM>$IPC::Shareable::Debug</EM> to a true value to produce *many* verbose debugging messages on the
standard error (I don't use the Perl debugger as much as I should... )
